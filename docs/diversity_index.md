#### Shannon Diversity Index: A measure that accounts for both abundance and evenness of species.
The Shannon Diversity Index, also known as the Shannon-Wiener or Shannon-Weaver index, is a measure of community diversity that accounts for both abundance and evenness of the species present. It sensitive to species richness and evenness across all species, making it suitable for communities with many rare species.

* <u>A higher value of Shannon index indicates a more diverse and stable community.</u>

#### Simpson's Diversity Index: A measure that accounts for the probability of two individuals belonging to the same species.
The Simpson's Diversity Index measures the probability that two individuals randomly selected from a sample will belong to the same species. It takes into account both the number of species present (richness) and the relative abundance of each species (evenness).

* <u>Higher values indicate lower diversity, as it imples that one or a few species dominate the community.</u>
* <u>Lower values indicate higher diversity, meaning a more even distribution of species abundances.</u>
