Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) is a statistical method used to identify species that are strongly associated with specific groups or conditions, such as different stages of succession in fungal communities. ISA can provide insights into which species are characteristic of particular stages or conditions, helping to understand the ecological dynamics and succession patterns. The indicator values and statistical significance determine which species are most strongly associated with each group or stage.

#### Indicator Value
The indicator value (IndVal) combines two components:
* Specificity (A): The proportion of the species’ abundance found in a particular group compared to the total abundance across all groups.
* Fidelity (B): The proportion of sites or samples in the group where the species is present.

Indicator values ranges from 0 to 1. When an indicator is equal to 1, that means the species is found exclusively of one group and is present in all samples of that group (perfect indicator). When the indicator value is equal to 0 for a group, the species is not a good indicator for any group.

* <u>High indicator value: Indicates that the species is a strong indicator of a particular group or stage. It is both frequent and abundant in that group.</u>
* <u>Low indicator value: Indicates that the species is not specific to any group or is found infrequently and in low abundance.</u>

#### P-value
The p-value tests the statistical significance of the observed indicator value. It is typically obtained through permutation tests. Common thresholds for significance are p < 0.05 or p < 0.01.

<b>Low vs High</b>
* <u>Low p-value (< 0.05): Suggests that the observed indicator value is unlikely to have occurred by chance, indicating a significant association between the species and the group.</u>
* <u>High p-value (≥ 0.05): Suggests that the observed indicator value could have occurred by chance, indicating no significant association.</u>

<b>Significant vs Non-Significant</b>
* <u>Significant p-value (e.g., p < 0.05): The species is a significant indicator of the group or stage, meaning it has a strong association with that group.</u>
* <u>Non-significant p-value (e.g., p ≥ 0.05): The species is not a significant indicator of the group, meaning any observed association might be due to random chance.</u>
