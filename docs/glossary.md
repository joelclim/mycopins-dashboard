## Glossary
#### Alpha diversity
Alpha diversity refers to the species diversity within a particular area, community, or ecosystem.

It is typically measured over a relatively small, homogeneous area and is a local measure of biodiversity.

Alpha diversity captures the variety of species in a given habitat and includes aspects such as species richness (the total number of different species) and evenness (how equal the populations of those species are).

#### Analysis of Similarities
The Analysis of Similarities (ANOSIM) is a non-parametric statistical test used to compare the similarity of groups of samples. It is widely used in ecological studies to test whether there is a significant difference in community composition between groups. ANOSIM operates on a ranked dissimilarity matrix and provides an R statistic that reflects the degree of separation between groups, as well as a p-value indicating the significance of the observed separation.

#### Beta diversity
Beta diversity measures the variation in species composition between ecosystems or communities and is an important concept in ecology to understand species turnover or replacement across environmental gradients or different habitats.

It quantifies the extent of change in community composition between sites, providing insights into ecological processes like dispersal, speciation, and extinction.

#### Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix
The Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix is a widely used measure in community ecology to quantify the dissimilarity between two sites based on the composition of species within each site.

Unlike other distance measures that might focus solely on presence or absence data, Bray-Curtis dissimilarity takes into account the abundance of species, making it especially useful for ecological datasets where species counts are important.

#### Gamma diversity
Gamma diversity refers to the overall diversity within a large geographic area that encompasses multiple ecosystems or habitats. This concept is part of a framework that helps ecologists understand the scale-dependent nature of biodiversity. Gamma diversity is a broad-scale measure and incorporates both alpha (local) diversity and beta (between habitats) diversity, effectively representing the total species diversity observed across all ecological communities within the region.

#### Indicator Species Analysis
Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) is a statistical method used to identify species that are strongly associated with specific groups or conditions, such as different stages of succession in fungal communities. ISA can provide insights into which species are characteristic of particular stages or conditions, helping to understand the ecological dynamics and succession patterns.

#### Jaccard dissimilarity matrix
The Jaccard dissimilarity matrix is a statistical tool used to measure the dissimilarity between sets, commonly used in ecology to assess the dissimilarity between community compositions.

It is based on the Jaccard index, which quantifies the similarity between finite sample sets and is defined as the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union of the sample sets.

It quantifies how different or similar various sets are, particularly in terms of species presence or absence. Its straightforward interpretation and the effective way it handles binary data make it particularly useful for studies involving categorical data.

#### Manhattan distance
Manhattan distance (also known as city block distance or L1 distance) is a useful dissimilarity measure that measures the distance between two points in a grid-based system, summing the absolute differences of their coordinates. In the context of ecological data, it can be used to assess the dissimilarity between samples based on species abundance or presence/absence data.

#### Non-metric multidimensional scaling
Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) is an ordination technique used in statistics, particularly in ecology, to visualize the similarity or dissimilarity of data.

NMDS is a non-parametric method that attempts to represent the pairwise dissimilarity between objects in a low-dimensional space, typically two or three dimensions.

Unlike methods that rely on linear assumptions (e.g., PCA), NMDS uses a rank-order procedure to preserve the ordinal relationships among dissimilarities without assuming a particular linear or monotonic relationship between variables.

An NMDS ordination with a stress value around or above 0.2 is deemed suspect and a stress value approaching 0.3 indicates that the ordination is arbitrary. Stress values equal to or below 0.1 are considered fair, while values equal to or below 0.05 indicate good fit.

#### Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance (PERMANOVA)
PERMANOVA (Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance) is a non-parametric statistical test used to compare the differences in community composition among groups.

#### Shannon Index
The Shannon Index, also known as the Shannon-Wiener or Shannon-Weaver index, is a measure of community diversity that accounts for both abundance and evenness of the species present.

It is used in ecology to compare the diversity of different communities, understand ecological complexity, and assess the effects of environmental disturbances.

A higher value of Shannon index indicates a more diverse and stable community.

It sensitive to species richness and evenness across all species, making it suitable for communities with many rare species

#### Simpson's (Diversity) Index
The Simpson's Index measures the probability that two individuals randomly selected from a sample will belong to the same species.

Simpson's Diversity Index (reciprocal or inverse Simpson index) is often used to facilitate comparison with other diversity indices. Higher values of this inverse indicate greater diversity.

Simpson's Index emphasizes the presence of dominant species, making it useful in communities where a few species are overwhelmingly abundant.

#### Species richness
Species richness is a measure of biodiversity that quantifies the number of different species present in an ecological community, landscape, or region. It is one of the simplest and most intuitive indices of biodiversity, focusing solely on the count of species without considering the abundance of each species.
